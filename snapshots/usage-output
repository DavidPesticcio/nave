Usage: nave <cmd>

COMMANDS

  install <version>     Install the version specified (ex: 12.8.0)
  install <name> <ver>  Install the version as a named env
  use <version>         Enter a subshell where <version> is being used
  use <ver> <program>   Enter a subshell, and run "<program>", then exit
  use <name> <ver>      Create a named env, using the specified version.
                        If the name already exists, but the version differs,
                        then it will update the link.
  usemain <version>     Install in /usr/local/bin (ie, use as your main nodejs)
  clean <version>       Delete the source code for <version>
  uninstall <version>   Delete the install for <version>
  ls                    List versions currently installed
  ls-remote             List remote node versions
  ls-all                List remote and local node versions
  latest                Show the most recent dist version
  cache                 Clear or view the cache
  help                  Output help information
  auto                  Find a .naverc and then be in that env
                        If no .naverc is found, then alias for 'nave exit'
  auto <dir>            cd into <dir>, then find a .naverc, and be in that env
                        If no .naverc is found, then alias for 'nave exit' in
                        the specified directory.
  auto <dir> <cmd>      cd into <dir>, then find a .naverc, and run a command
                        in that env
                        If no .naverc is found, then alias for 'nave exit <cmd>'
                        in the specified directory.
  should-auto           Exits with 1 if the nave auto env already
                        matches the config, or 0 if a change should
                        be made (ie, by calling 'nave auto')
                        An explicit call to 'nave use' or 'nave exit' will
                        tell nave that it should NOT auto.
  get <variable>        Print out various nave config values.
  exit                  Unset all the NAVE environs (use with 'exec')
  exit <cmd>            Run the specified command in a nave-free environment
                        (Note that nave will still set NAVE_EXIT=1 in order to
                        prevent 'nave should-auto' from evaluating true.)

VERSION STRINGS

  Any command that calls for a version can be provided any of the
  following "version-ish" identifies:

  - x.y.z       A specific SemVer tuple
  - x.y         Major and minor version number
  - x           Just a major version number
  - lts         The most recent LTS (long-term support) node version
  - lts/<name>  The latest in a named LTS set. (argon, boron, etc.)
  - lts/*       Same as just "lts"
  - latest      The most recent (non-LTS) version
  - stable      Backwards-compatible alias for "lts".

  To exit a nave subshell, type 'exit' or press ^D.
  To run nave *without* a subshell, do 'exec nave use <version>'.
  To clear the settings from a nave env, use 'exec nave exit'

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

  The following environment variables can be set to change nave's behavior.

  NAVE_DIR        Root directory for nave to operate in.  Defaults to
                  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nave if set (eg, ~/.config/nave), or
                  ~/.nave otherwise.
  NAVE_NPX        Set this to '1' to add node_modules/.bin to the PATH
  NAVE_DEBUG      Set this to '1' to run in debug mode.
  NAVE_CACHE_DUR  Duration in seconds to cache version information (86400)
  NAVEUA          User-agent header to send when fetching version information
  NAVE_SRC_ONLY   Set to '1' to *only* build node from source, and never use
                  binary distributions.  (This is much slower!)
  NAVE_JOBS       Set to the number of JOBS to use when building node.
                  Defaults to the number of CPUs on the system.
  NODEDIST        The distribution server to fetch node from.  Defaults to
                  https://nodejs.org/dist
  NAVE_CONFIG     Arguments to pass to ./configure when building from source.

  Nave sets the following environment variables when in use:

  NAVE            A descriptive string of the nave setting in use.
  NAVENAME        The name, in named subshells, otherwise $NAVEVERSION
  NAVEVERSION     The version of node in use.
  NAVEVERSIONARG  The version specifier provided ("18.13" or "lts", etc.)
  NAVELVL         The number of subshells currently in use (like bash $SHLVL)
  NAVE_LOGIN      '1' in interactive nave subshells, '0' otherwise.
  NAVE_ROOT       Location of nave installed environments
  NAVE_SRC        Location of downloaded Node.js source
  NAVE_AUTO_RC    The .naverc file used by 'nave auto'
  NAVE_AUTO_CFG   The contents of the .naverc file used by 'nave auto'

CONFIGURATION FILES

  Nave subshells will source the same .bashrc, .bash_profile, .zprofile, etc.
  configuration files as normal shells, based on whether it is being run as a
  login shell, or to run a specific command.

  In addition, after sourcing the normal shell profile files, nave looks for
  environment specific '.nave_profile_*' files, first in the $NAVE_DIR
  (~/.config/nave if present, otherwise ~/.nave), and then by walking up from
  the current working directory.

  The walk up process stops when it encounters a folder with a '.git' entry,
  or when it hits the user's $HOME directory.

  The environment-specific .nave_profile files that it searches for are:

    .nave_profile_${NAVE}
    .nave_profile_${NAVENAME}, if a named environment
    .nave_profile_${NAVEVERSION}, eg .nave_profile_18.13.0
    .nave_profile_${NAVEVERSION major.minor}, eg .nave_profile_18.13
    .nave_profile_${NAVEVERSION major}, eg .nave_profile_18
    .nave_profile

  Finally, it will always source ${NAVE_DIR}/../.naverc if present.
  (eg, ~/.config/.naverc or ~/.naverc)

  These may be used to set project-specific confirations, env variables, or
  other behavior based on the Nave environment in use, without the use of
  configuration files in the home directory.

  The 'nave auto' command will walk up the directory tree looking for a
  '.naverc' or '.nvmrc' file, and use the contents as arguments to 'nave use'.
